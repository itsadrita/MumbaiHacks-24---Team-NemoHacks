### Introduction
Our country needs to make public spaces safer. Can an AI powered system solve for reducing the rate of crimes against women?

The problem SafeShe solves:
Women face heightened safety risks, with limited effective tools for real-time protection. Existing solutions often lack the features needed to address these challenges holistically.

How It Helps
This solution offers a combination of real-time unsafe zone mapping, AR-based self-defense tutorials, and anonymous incident reporting, allowing users to:

* Avoid high-risk areas (By mapping unsafe zones on G-Map)
* Plan safer routes
* Learn self-defense techniques through AR
* Report incidents anonymously to alert others
* Legal Assist AI (Using Meta's Llama-3.1-8b-instant) (With Multilingual support)
* Pairing commuting women together to avoid sexual assaulters lurking around solitary women
* 
By providing data-backed safety insights, interactive defense training, and discreet reporting, it empowers users to protect themselves and others more effectively.
